# ƱpnFʊnR - Dataset on Alveolar Rhotics from Sud-Oranais (Berber language)

Between 2015 and 2017, I carried out several fieldworks in the Sud-Oranais (Algeria). Hence, I have created this web-app, made with Shiny, in order to share a sample of my data and make my work available to the scientific community.

The development of this interface follows on from my thesis that I achieved at INALCO: Linguistic description of endangered Berber varieties of Sud-Oranais (Algeria) - A dialectological, phonetic and phonological study of the consonantic system.

The purpose of this web application, called ƱpnFʊnR, is to offer an interactive signal processing of a phonetic corpus on the alveolar rhotics.
